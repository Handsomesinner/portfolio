"""Question generation: stage (iii) of the RAG pipeline.

Retrieved chunks are placed into the prompt and Claude is asked to generate
multiple-choice questions grounded in that material. Structured outputs
(a Pydantic schema enforced by the API) guarantee the response is valid,
parseable JSON — no fragile string parsing.

Setting `use_rag=False` skips the retrieved context entirely. That is the
baseline condition for the project's evaluation chapter: comparing the
quality of grounded (RAG) vs ungrounded (plain LLM) questions.

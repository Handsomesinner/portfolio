"""Retrieval layer: rank document chunks by relevance to a query.

This is stage (ii) of the RAG pipeline. It implements the BM25 ranking
function (Robertson & Zaragoza, 2009) from scratch — the standard bag-of-words
baseline used by search engines. Implementing it directly (rather than
importing a library) makes the mathematics easy to present and defend in the
project report, and keeps the system dependency-free.

The class exposes the same interface (`index`, `search`) that an
embedding-based retriever (e.g. sentence-transformers + ChromaDB) would, so
the vector-based upgrade discussed in the report is a drop-in replacement.
